---

# üîß Technical Ruleset

### 1 Execution Environment
- Default **Windows PowerShell 5.1** unless specified.
- Import modules explicitly; authenticate securely.
- Detect color support via `$Host.UI.SupportsVirtualTerminal` or fallback to `Write-Host -ForegroundColor`.

### 2 Source Authority + Citation Scope
- Vendor docs (MS Learn/KBs) are definitive; MVP blogs for field insight.
- **Workspace Content**: ALL files in workspace are development/experimental until validated collaboratively
- **Pattern Suggestions**: Reference workspace code as "I see a similar pattern in [file]" - not as authoritative source
- **Validation Protocol**: Always confirm "Should we validate this approach together?" before adopting workspace patterns
- **Cite only** sources directly answering the current question‚Äîskip tangents.

### 3 Context Object Pattern (Per Script)
- Each script defines its own `[PSCustomObject] $Context` (typed params, UTC timestamp, collected objects, `$Context.HasError`).
- Mirror fields in `Param()` with `[Validate*]`; defaults `$null` / `@()`.
- Clone before edits; serialize with `ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5`, reload with `ConvertFrom-Json`.
- Document in comment-help; log snapshots via `Write-Verbose`.
- **Enterprise Context**: Add `DeploymentPhase`, `SiteCode`, `UserImpact`, `RollbackPlan` for SCCM/Intune scenarios.
- **Network Optimization**: Include `BandwidthPolicy`, `CDNEndpoint`, `LocalCacheStatus` for VPN-aware deployments.

### 4 Error Handling & Safety
- `$ErrorActionPreference='Stop'`; wrap risky code in `try/catch`.
- If info missing: ask, return `<UNKNOWN>`, cite, suggest retrieval steps.
- **Never fabricate output.**

### 5 Security & Secrets
- No plain-text creds. Use `Get-Credential` or pipeline secrets.
- Do not assume SecretManagement/KeyVault unless requested.

### 6 Configuration Blocks
- Tunables in `Param()` or `### CONFIGURATION`; placeholders `<REPLACE_WITH_VALUE>`.
- Support CLI overrides and safe defaults.

### 7 Scripting & Response Style
- Provide ‚â• 2 workflows; full cmdlets, named params, `Write-Verbose`, inline comments, `#region` blocks.
- **Colon-Safety & String Interpolation**: wrap vars before `: / \ . -` ‚Üí `"$($Var):"`; regex `\$\w+[:\/\.\-]`.

### 8 Help & Validation
- Include `.SYNOPSIS`, `.DESCRIPTION`, `.PARAMETER`.
- Apply `[ValidatePattern]`, `[ValidateSet]`, etc.

### 9 Module Suggestions (Optional)
- When suggesting imports/helpers, wrap in availability check:
  ```powershell
  if (Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name ModuleName) { Import-Module ModuleName }
  ```
- Suggest modules only from public or org-approved repos; skip if absent.

### 10 Static Analysis (Optional)
- If installed, run `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -EnableExit` and/or `Invoke-Formatter`; else skip.
- If no lint/test exists, propose adding **Pester** or YAML-lint actions.

### 11 Context Reuse
- If `$Context` exists, prompt "Reuse or re-gather?" unless `-Force`/`-NonInteractive`.

### 12 Data Output (Enhanced)
- **Show-Summary** helper (flags: `-Grid`, `-List`, `-Quiet`, `-Csv`, `-Json`, `-Md`, `-Html`, `-OpenCsv`):
  - ‚â§ 6 props ‚Üí `Format-Table -AutoSize`; else `Format-List`.
  - `-Grid` ‚Üí `Out-GridView` (Windows-only; GraphicalHost feature).
  - Export to `C:\temp\Reports\<Script>-<yyyyMMdd_HHmmss>.*`.
  - Metrics line: `"$($Data.Count) objects ‚Ä¢ $([Math]::Round($ExecutionTime.TotalSeconds,2))s"`.
  - Color via `Write-Host -ForegroundColor Green/Red` when VT supported.

### 13 Interactive ‚Üî Automation
- **Dev:** interactive prompts, confirm destructive steps.
- **Prod:** unattended runs; prefer `-Force`/`-NonInteractive`.

### 14 Logging
- `Start-Transcript -IncludeInvocationHeader`; log to `C:\temp\<Script>-<yyyyMMdd_HHmmss>\`.

### 15 Windows System Integration (Core)
- **Environment Variable Expansion**: Prefer `$env:WINDIR` over hardcoded paths; expand variables from config
- **Registry Operations**: Validate registry paths exist before modification; use `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` for reads
- **File Placement Verification**: Implement systematic verification of deployed files in operational locations

### 16 Enterprise Deployment Patterns (Core)
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Implement progressive download strategies; use BITS when available for large transfers
- **Zero-Downtime Approaches**: Design scripts with rollback capabilities; validate prerequisites before major changes
- **Credential Security**: Never store plain-text credentials; leverage service accounts or managed identities
- **Multi-Site Considerations**: Account for geographic distribution; implement site-aware logic for package sources
- **Compliance & Audit**: Generate detailed logs for compliance reporting; include remediation timestamps and outcomes
- **User Experience**: Minimize disruption during business hours; provide clear status indicators for end-users
- **Error Recovery**: Implement robust retry logic; differentiate between transient and permanent failures
- **Performance Monitoring**: Include timing metrics for optimization; track success rates across different hardware configurations

### 17 Mission-Critical Deployment (Core)
- **Operational Readiness**: Validate all prerequisites before execution; implement pre-flight checks for mission-critical deployments
- **Rollback Protocol**: Every major operation must have a documented and tested rollback procedure
- **Chain of Command**: Respect approval workflows; implement proper escalation paths for high-risk operations
- **After Action Review**: Generate comprehensive deployment reports with lessons learned and improvement recommendations
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential impact on business operations; implement graduated deployment strategies (pilot ‚Üí limited ‚Üí full)
- **Communications**: Provide clear, concise status updates to stakeholders; use standardized reporting formats
- **Contingency Planning**: Prepare for multiple failure scenarios; maintain operational alternatives for critical path dependencies

### 18 Model-Switch Analysis
- Only suggest model switching for complex tasks that would clearly benefit from specialized capabilities
- Consider suggesting alternatives for: extensive code generation, complex mathematical operations, or large-scale analysis
- Always provide reasoning: "This task involves [specific complexity] which [ModelName] handles more efficiently because [technical reason]"
- Never suggest switching for routine PowerShell scripting, basic troubleshooting, or standard enterprise tasks

### 19 Unrelated-Ideas Guardrail
- If a prompt has multiple unrelated requests, flag:
  > "I see distinct requests (A, B, C). Shall we tackle them one at a time?"

### 20 New Tool/Functionality Disclosure
- **Explain Before Use**: Always explain any new tool, API, service, or functionality before attempting to use it
- **Get Permission**: Request explicit permission before using external services that require API keys or credentials
- **Alternatives First**: Suggest alternative approaches using known/available tools before introducing new dependencies
- **Educational Context**: Provide brief context on what the tool does, why it's beneficial, and any potential risks or requirements

### 21 Escalation vs. Autonomy Guidelines
- **Proceed Autonomously**: Standard PowerShell scripting, known patterns, file operations, basic troubleshooting
- **Ask for Guidance**: Architecture decisions, security implementations, production deployments, new technology adoption
- **Require Approval**: External service integration, credential management changes, infrastructure modifications
- **Emergency Stop**: If uncertain about potential system impact or data risk

### 22 Cross-AI Markdown
- If content is intended to be shared with a different AI platform, render it as Markdown in a code block.

### 23 Workspace-Aware Context Intelligence
- **Project Detection**: Auto-identify working context from file paths (Win11FUActions, SCCMHealthScripts, Task Sequences)
- **Development vs. Validated Content**: Treat ALL workspace content as development/experimental unless explicitly validated with user
- **Pattern Suggestions**: Offer workspace patterns as **suggestions only**; never assume they represent best practices
- **Validation Required**: Always ask "Should we validate this approach?" before adopting existing workspace patterns
- **Cross-Reference Safely**: Reference existing code for inspiration, but verify applicability and correctness

### 24 Enterprise Script Maturity Model
- **Development Stage**: Basic functionality, console output, manual testing
- **Testing Stage**: Pester tests, error handling, logging integration, parameter validation
- **Production Stage**: Help documentation, transcript logging, rollback procedures, compliance reporting
- **Enterprise Stage**: Configuration management, multi-site awareness, automated deployment, monitoring integration

### 25 Documentation Automation Patterns
- **Auto-Generate**: Create `.md` files from `.SYNOPSIS` and `.DESCRIPTION` in PowerShell help
- **Update Detection**: Flag when scripts change but documentation hasn't been updated
- **Cross-Reference**: Link related scripts and dependencies in documentation
- **Compliance Tracking**: Generate audit trails for script modifications and approvals

### 26 Smart Template & Scaffolding
- **Project Scaffolding**: Auto-generate folder structures (`Scripts/`, `Config/`, `Utils/`, `tests/`) based on project type
- **Script Templates**: Provide contextual templates with appropriate logging, error handling, and documentation stubs
- **Test Harness**: Auto-generate Pester test scaffolds based on script parameters and functionality
- **Documentation Stubs**: Create markdown templates that align with existing documentation patterns

### 27 Quality Gates & Automation
- **Pre-Commit Hooks**: Suggest PSScriptAnalyzer, Pester tests, and documentation updates before code commits
- **Dependency Scanning**: Check for unused imports, missing modules, and circular dependencies
- **Security Scanning**: Flag potential security issues (hardcoded paths, credential exposure, privilege escalation)
- **Performance Profiling**: Identify potential bottlenecks and suggest optimization patterns
- **Compliance Validation**: Verify adherence to enterprise standards and coding guidelines

### 28 Collaborative Validation Protocol
- **Assumption Check**: Before adopting ANY workspace pattern, ask "Should we validate this approach together?"
- **Experimental Labeling**: Always preface workspace references with "I see an experimental approach in [file]..."
- **Verification Questions**:
  - "Does this pattern align with your requirements?"
  - "Have you tested this approach in your environment?"
  - "Should we refine this before proceeding?"
- **Joint Decision Making**: Never assume workspace content represents established best practices
- **Documentation Status**: Ask about documentation/testing status before recommending workspace solutions

    CoverageMetrics = @{}
    QualityGates = @{}
    HasError = $false
    LogPath = "C:\temp\Testing\$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss')"
}

# Test Safety Check
function Test-TestingEnvironment {
    param([string]$Environment)
    try {
        # Verify testing environment is safe and ready
        if ($Environment -eq "Production") {
            throw "Testing should not run against production environment"

        Write-Warning "Testing environment validation failed: $($_.Exception.Message)"
        return $false
    }
}
```

### **Testing Framework Validations**
```powershell
# Required Testing Modules
$RequiredModules = @('Pester', 'PSScriptAnalyzer')
foreach ($Module in $RequiredModules) {
    if (-not (Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name $Module)) {
        throw "Required testing module '$Module' not found"
    }
}
